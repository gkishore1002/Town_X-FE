            answer={
              <p>
                {APP_NAME} is a Chennai-focused property marketplace that connects renters and
                buyers directly with owners — with no platform brokerage fees. Browse listings,
                save favourites, watch property stories, and contact owners after signing in.

            question="Is Town Exchange free to use?"
            answer={
              <p>
                Yes. Creating an account, browsing listings, saving favourites, and using most
                features is free. {APP_NAME} does not charge brokerage commission. Any rent, sale
                price, or deposit is agreed directly between you and the property owner.

            answer={
              <p>
                Anyone 18 or older can register. Choose a role when signing up — typically
                buyer/renter for people searching for property, or owner for people listing
                properties. Administrators manage the platform separately.

                Login protects your favourites, enables property stories, lets owners post
                listings, and helps us keep the community safe. The public marketing page at /

                type, price range, furnishing, and sort options to narrow results. On mobile you

                We focus on Chennai and surrounding neighbourhoods. Coverage grows as more owners
                list properties. Use locality and city filters to find homes in your preferred
                area.

            answer={
              <p>
                Stories are short photo or video updates owners share about a listing. They appear
                for 24 hours — great for fresh availability, open-house reminders, or quick
                walkthrough clips. Tap a story ring on the home feed to view it.

                list anytime from the Favourites page in the app navigation.

                Basic listing on {APP_NAME} is free during our current launch phase. If we

                Owners have a dedicated dashboard showing active listings, views, and quick actions.
